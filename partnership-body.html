<p>We love to partner with organizations that reach their audiences through video. Examples of such organizations and how we can help include:</p><br />
<p>1. You provide videos like educational content for students. We can use our Yopisode Ambassador Network in schools to organize students and organize a video show in campus.</p><br />
<p>2. You are on a campaign (e.g. sensitization campaigns), and you want to scale your sensitization through video, we can help organize video shows with your sensitization video content.</p><br />
<p>3. You have released a new movie or entertainment video and you want many people to watch it (for free), we can use our Yopisode Ambassador Network to organize students in campuses to consume your video.</p><br />
<p>If you are interested in a partnership for any of the above reasons or for any other alike reasons, feel free to email our Business Development Manager on partnership@yopisode.com</p>
