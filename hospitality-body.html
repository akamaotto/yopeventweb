				<cite>“We dare not trust our wit for making our house pleasant to our friend, so we buy ice cream. ”</cite><br /> ― Ralph Waldo Emerson<br /><br />
				<p>
				When guests are with you because you invited them to watch TV, hospitality is about whole-heartedly doing everything to make sure they have fun.</p><br />

				<p>
					Note that guests have the tendency to always do what you tell them to do. Also, telling people to feel at home without any guidance can be quite uncomfortable. Give your guests freedom while balancing it by asking them open ended questions. Always offer a helping hand.
				</p><br />

				<p>
					Keep it real, feigned hospitality can be sniffed a mile away.
				</p><br />

				<p>
					<cite>“When hospitality becomes an art, it loses its very soul. ”</cite><br /> ― Max Beerbohm<br />
				</p><br />

				<p>
					The comfort of your guests is your core responsibility. It is more important than the quality of the seats or the video quality of the TV program.
				</p><br />

				<p>Offer something extra. For free events, a packet of pop corn could be magical. For paid events always offer all what was promised. You never know what the guests really paid for, so ignore nothing and delight them with a surprise.</p><br />

				<p>If they really want to come again, it means it was a success. It means you are hospitable.</p>
