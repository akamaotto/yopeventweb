<p><strong>A Spot</strong> is a physical place where anyone could organize a yopevent. These places are usually availble to the public as drinking spots, beer parlors or cinemas.</p><br /> 

<p>Anyone can submit a spot as long as it is openly available. However, the owners will need to verify with Yopisode to get the spot verified and/ or acknowledged as <strong>'Suitable for yopevents'</strong>.</p><br />

<p>Choosing a spot for a yopevent does not give you exclusive rights. If you choose a spot for your yopevent, it is advisable to make sure it will be available to you so as to avoid embarrasment. Like any other event your yopevent will need some degree of planning and logistics.</p><br />

<p>It is not advisable to list your personal home as a spot. We do not encourage bringing total strangers to your home. However if you organize yopevents at your home for some commercial reasons, you can do what you want without breaching our policies at your own risk. Just make sure you do not jeopardize the safety of your guests.</p><br />

<p>Spots listing is a feature on development...<br />Listing your business place as a spot will also help in your local search results and pull more customers to your business.<br /><br />Coming soon.</p>
