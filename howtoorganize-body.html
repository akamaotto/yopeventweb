<p>Organizing and hosting a yopevent is an easy three step process. All you have to do is:</p><br />
<p>
	<ol>
		<li><strong>Create a yopevent:</strong> Sort out what you'll want to watch with your friends. Fill in your YopEvent details and choose a great cover photo. Once it's cool, and you're done.</li><br />
		<li><strong>Invite Friends:</strong> Make all your friends aware of your YopEvent with our powerful promotion tools. Our tools help you invite your friends on Facebook, Twitter, Google+ and Email.</li><br />
		<li><strong>Make it happen:</strong> Now, your friends love your taste of TV Shows and they really want to watch TV with you. See how many people are coming and make preparations to make it fun.</li>
	</ol>
</p><br />
<h3>The Organizer</h3>
<p>As you use our platform to find yopevents around you, consider that Yopisode, Inc. is not the actual organizer for your yopevent. Each individual yopevent organizer is responsible for managing the details of his or her yopevent.</p> <br />

<p>The Organizer is responsible setting the ticket price, number of spaces available, setting the spot, creating the event content and promoting his yopevent. The organizer is the one who makes the yopevent possible, and he can cancel the yopevent</p>
