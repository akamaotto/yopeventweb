<h3>In The Yester-Years</h3>
<p>Storytelling was awesome. friends and family gathered together under starry skies and told stories.</p><br />

<h3>And Later...</h3>
<p>Storytellers wrote great stories and friends read stories together.</p><br />

<h3>Radio Soap</h3>
<p>Storytelling got to the radio and housewives in the neighbourhood get together to listen to Soap Operas on radio.</p><br />

<h3>The Television</h3>
<p>The whole family plus neighbours get together in the evenings to watch TV.</p><br />

<h3>Today's Hi-Tech TV Life</h3>
<p>Nowadays, everyone can afford a TV. There are online videos avaialble for free streaming, and with tools like Chromecast, Roku, Youtube and PlutoTV, the experience is improved daily. There is also the rise of high quality flat wide screen Ultra HD TV. However, this has led to people watching TV in silos. Half the fun is gone. Facebook and Twitter link sharing are not enough.</p><br />

<h3>Let's Watch TV Together - Yopisode TV Lifestyle</h3>
